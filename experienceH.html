Beyond medical assistance, it addresses the social, emotional, and economic needs of individuals and their families affected by HIV/AIDS, striving to enhance their overall quality of life. In M&E, using the Electronic Medical Records (EMR) system my role encompassed data analysis, program evaluation, and reporting. These tasks encompassed data entry and data analysis using statistical software, monitoring program progress, preparing reports, and providing support for other evaluation-related tasks. In addition, assisted with the mobile van outreach services. This initiative aimed to provide comprehensive HIV services to key and priority populations living in hard-to-reach areas. Given their elevated risk of contracting HIV, our outreach efforts included HIV prevention messages, treatment services, ART distribution, and gender-based violence (GBV) support.</td>
